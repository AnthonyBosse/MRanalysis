==== 09/27/95  Update ===========================================

The SaGA version 1.3 (as of 09/28/95) is now complete.
    ----------------

There were both additions and improvement/correction of various routines
in comparison to previous sub-release.

One important addition is a function INPOLYHD (and its auxillaries)
which determines whether points in a set are inside or outside of
a multi-dimensional polyhedron.

Also important is that most of the programs dealing with polygons,
such as ISCROSS.M, INTSECL.M, INTSECPL.M, ISINTPL.M, POLYBOOL.M
were improved for correct handling various exceptional and degenerate
situations.

DELAUNAY.M is corrected so that it always produces exact n-dimensional
Delaunay triangulation.

Interpolation routines INTERPTR.M and its auxillaries EXTRAPTR.M,
INFLATE.M, ADJSPX.M are also improved to deal with special cases.

CONVEXH.M is improved for better handling of degenerate-rank cases.

Added functions:
---------------

 BINARY.M    - binary representation of an integer
               (used in COMBIN);

 COMBIN.M    - combinations of N choose K
               (used in ROTMAT);

 INPOLYHD.M  - true for a point in a multi-dimensional polyhedron;

 INSPX0.M    - true for a points inside a multi-dimensional simplex
               (auxillary for INPOLYHD);

 INTERVAL.M  - intersection and union of 1-d intervals (used in
               some polygon routines);

 LINECHK.M   - checks line type input arguments, used in ISCROSS,
               INTSECL;

 ROTMAT.M    - multi-dimensional rotation matrix
               (used in INPOLYHD);

 UNIQUEPT.M  - removes coincident points in many interpolation
               routines;

 Doclist     - a summary of various types of documentation
               for SaGA.




==== 06/30/95  Update ==========================================
(posted to the MATLAB newsgroup):

Here I announce the completion of a suite of various
routines for polygon computations within the SaGA -
Spatial and Geometric Analysis toolbox.

  Planar geometry is quite an important area for many
applications and related questions are fairly often
asked in this newsgroup.
  Unfortunately MATLAB currently offers very little
here except plotting commands. Even such basic functions
as polygon area or intersection of line segments 
calculations are not available.

SaGA in addition to its core spatial data interpolation
and computational geometry routines now contains many
functions for dealing with points, lines and polygons.

They range from relatively simple, like area and centroid
calculations to quite sophisticated ones, like Boolean
operation on pairs of polygons (intersections, unions.
etc.) For the latter see a graphics example in the 
"gallery".



======================================================
============ Further development =====================

The functions to be added in the nearest few days:
------------------------------------------------------

 Additional demo, info scripts 


Functionalities which are soon to be included in SaGA:
------------------------------------------------------
  Interpolation by objective mapping and kriging methods
with automatic calculation of correlation function and
semi-variogram respectively; automatic rescaling

  Objective mapping and kriging of 3-dimensional
datasets.

  Adaptive (successive correction)
multi-dimensional inverse distance interpolation.

  2-d natural neighbour interpolation 
(based on Delaunay tesselation).
